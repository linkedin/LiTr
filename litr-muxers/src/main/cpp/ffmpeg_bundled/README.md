# Litr Muxers / Bundled FFmpeg

This folder contains a pre-built version of the required ffmpeg dependencies, along with the headers
required to build against it. This is purely provided for simplicity to consume this module, however
it is still preferable for the consumers to build and use their own binaries (and source) rather
than what is provided here.

The binaries/source included here are copied from git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg (release/4.2)
